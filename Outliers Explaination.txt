A quantile is a statistical term that represents a data point or a set of data points that divide a dataset into specific intervals or portions. Quantiles are used to understand the distribution of a dataset by providing information about the relative standing of individual values within that dataset.


The p-th quantile, denoted as Q(p), is the value below which p percent of the data falls. The most commonly used quantiles are the median (Q(0.5)), quartiles (Q(0.25), Q(0.5), and Q(0.75)), and percentiles (Q(0.01), 


The formula to calculate the p-th quantile of a dataset is as follows:

Q(p)=value at (p×(number of data points+1)/100)th position in the sorted dataset

Consider the dataset: 3,6,7,8,8,10,13,15,16,20

Step1:Arrange the data in ascending order  -->3,6,7,8,8,10,13,15,16,20

Step2: Calculate Quartiles and IQR:

Quartiles:Q1(25th percentile):  


value at (25*11)/100 ---> value at 2.75-th position

Q 3(75th percentile): 

value at (75*11)/100 ---> value at 8.25-th position
​
Q1 = 6.5  (average of 2nd and 3rd values -->13/2)

Q3 = 15.75 (average of 8th and 9th values -->31/2)

IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 15.75 - 6.5 = 9.25


Step 3: Define Lower and Upper Bounds:

Lower Bound = Q1 - 1.5*IQR = 6.5 - 1.5*9.25 = -7.625

Upper Bound = Q3 + 1.5*IQR = 15.75 + 1.5*9.25 = 28.875

Step 4: Identify Outliers:

Any data point below the lower bound or above the upper bound is considered an outlier.


Step 5: Identify and Remove Outliers:

Based on the bounds, there are no outliers in this dataset.
In summary, the dataset does not contain any outliers based on the interquartile range (IQR) method with a threshold of 1.5. All values in the dataset fall within the calculated bounds.

A higher threshold might be appropriate in situations where you want to be more conservative in identifying outliers.
